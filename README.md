# Project Proposal : Pong

## Project Description
This is a recreation of the classic game from the 70s. Two players can play, whoever reaches a score of 5 first wins. Users will have the option to play again. In the future, I would like to add a feature where there is an automated player and a shrinking paddle as the game progresses, and a pause button for the musice and sound effects (for better accessibility)

## Technologies Used
I used HTML CSS and JavaScript to complete my game!

#### MVP Goals 

- As a player I want my game to recognize when the ball is off screen so a winner is declared. Completed
- As a player, I would like to be informed when the game is over. Completed
- As a player for those who require assistive technolog ies,I would like accessibility features so that others are not left out of enjoying the game. Completed but want to add more 
- As a player, I would like to be able to restart the game after a round is done. Completed
- As a player, I would like the UI to be engaging and easy on the eyes. Completed

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like to hear a little chime when the ball hits a paddle. Completed 
- As a player, I would like the game to increase in difficulty with a smaller paddle after every 5 strikes. not completed 
- As a player, I would like to have the option to play against the computer. Not completed

## Pseudocode 

- Define the required variables used to track the state of the game(ball position, paddle positions, scores)
- Store cached element references (Reset Buttone, Winner Message, Game Board, Paddle 1, Paddle 2, Ball)
- Event Handlers (Key clicks for player 1, Key clicks for player 2)
- Game Logic (Update Board and Update Message)
- Function to render game (Call functions to update the board, update the message)
- Function to edge (keep game elements within the board boundaries)
- function to move the ball
- Function to bounce the ball off paddles and walls (only top and bottom walls)
- Function to determin a winner 
- Function to update the board (Upon load the page will have a set position and not being until a key click)
